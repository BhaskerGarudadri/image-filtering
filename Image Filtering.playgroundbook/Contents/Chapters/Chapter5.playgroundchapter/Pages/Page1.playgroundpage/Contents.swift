 # Congratulations üëèüéâüéà
 Take a moment and give yourself a pat on the shoulder!
 
 You've finished the book and [learned how the convolution works](Introduction/Images,%20Filters%20&%20Convolution), [how a blurring filter looks like](Blurring%20&%20Smoothing/Box%20Filter), [how you can detect edges in images](Edge%20detection/Sobel%20operator) and [created your own filter kernels](Custom%20filter/Filter%20Playground).
 
 # What's next
There is still a lot to discover on top of your new gained knowledge.
 
## Nonlinear filters
There are also many filters which are powerful but aren't linear and therefore aren't supported by the convolution like the bilateral filter which smoothes images but doesn't smooth edges.
 
## Convolution in the frequency domain
Like all signals, pictures can also be displayed in the frequency domain. The frequency domain offers many other ways to transform images. Additionally, convolutions are much faster in the frequency domain.
 
## Convolution Neural Networks
Convolution and filter kernels are also useful for machine learning applications. A Convolution Neural Network convolves different filters (mostly different edge detectors) to extract features from images or other signals.
 
## Convolving other Signals
Images and Audio Signals are more similar than you might think. All filters you've learned about can also get convolved as a one-dimensional version with audio signals.
